"""Who is signed in, and which boards they may see, when Bench is shared.

Off by default. `$BENCH_AUTH` unset or empty is the Mac board as it has always
been: nobody signs in, every board is visible, and `data/.current` says which
one is on screen. `BENCH_AUTH=header` is the server behind nginx. nginx asks
the sign-in service who the visitor is and passes the answer on in three
headers, and kanban/server.py refuses any request that arrives without one.
Any other value refuses to start, so a typo cannot leave a public board open.

    X-Offdesk-Email   the person's address, the identity everything keys on
    X-Offdesk-Name    their name, percent-encoded UTF-8
    X-Offdesk-Teams   the team ids they belong to, comma separated

Team membership comes from that header and from nowhere else. The list of
who is in which team is the sign-in service's (teams.json in
offdesk-server), so Bench keeps no copy that could disagree with it.

Each board says who may see it in `data/<board>/access.json`:

    {"owner": "a@example.com", "people": ["b@example.com"], "teams": ["offdesk"]}

Written by the server when a board is made or its sharing changes, and by
scripts/set-board-access.py for a board that existed before sign-in did.
With sign-in on, a board without the file, or with one that does not parse, is
visible to nobody: a board is opened up on purpose, never by accident. With it
off the file is not read at all.

Which board each person has on screen is theirs alone, in `data/users/`, one
file per person named from a hash of their address, so one person switching
boards does not switch anybody else's. The same file remembers the name they
first signed in with and the teams they last signed in with, which is how a
board's people are known: its owner and named people from access.json, and
everyone who has signed in as a member of one of its teams (board_people()).
Somebody in a board's team who has never signed in is not offered, because
Bench has never been told they exist.
