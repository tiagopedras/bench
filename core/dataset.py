"""Which list is in force, worked out one way for every Python reader.

`data/.current` names it. Missing or blank, the one list on disk is used when
there is exactly one, which covers a fresh clone with a single list in it. With
none or several there is no safe guess, so this raises rather than quietly
reading or writing some other list: a tick queued against the wrong list is
applied to the wrong card.

A list is a folder under the data root with a `todo.md` in it. A leading dot or
underscore marks something that is not one (`_test` is a fixture), the same
rule `agents/plan-agent/paths.py` lists them by.
