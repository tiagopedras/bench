"""Where a task's project folder is allowed to be, and the one check that says so.

A task names its folder in a note, `- Project: data/projects/<name>` for the
default place or `- Project: /some/absolute/path` for a folder of the person's
own. The default place, `data/<dataset>/projects/`, is always allowed. Anything
else has to sit inside a folder listed in `data/<dataset>/project-folders.json`,
which only the board writes, and only after the person has confirmed it.

With `projects_root` set in data/settings.json (core/settings.py), a bare name
is looked for at `<projects_root>/<name>/` first and under `data/<dataset>/projects/`
after, and a folder started from the board is made in the first (`home()`).
That folder is flat and shared by every list, bar those in
`projects_root_except`, which keep the one place they always had. `homes()`
names them in order; a folder in any of them needs no approval.

Everything that turns a note into a path on disk goes through `resolve()`: the
server's /project.json, its open-folder route, and the planning agent when it
decides which folders a planner may read. The check compares real paths with
os.path.commonpath, so a symlink or a `..` pointing out of an allowed folder is
caught after it is followed rather than before, and "/work-old" is never taken
for a child of "/work" the way a string-prefix test would take it.
