/* The to-do format, as the board reads and writes it.

   This is the authority. `core/todo.py` beside it is a port for the Python
   readers — the companion, the planning agent, the PA's checker — and its
   own docstring says that where the two disagree, this file is right and the
   Python is the bug. `core/fixtures/` is what stops that being a promise: both
   suites read the same tables, so a change here the fixtures do not expect
   fails in Python as well as in JavaScript.

   Three halves, which is one more than the name suggests:

     - parse and serialise. A document is buckets of tiers of tasks. Every line
       the board did not itself rewrite comes back verbatim, so saving a file
       nobody edited gives back the same bytes.
     - sub-steps and suggested messages. How deep a note is indented is what
       says whether it serves the task or one step inside it.
     - recurrence. `repeat:` says how often, `[due:: ]` says which occurrence the
       card is pointing at now, and neither is derivable from the other.

   What is deliberately not here: anything touching the DOM or `state`, and the
   working calendar. The calendar stays in todo.py alone — two files holding the
   same holiday list is two lists to keep in step.

   A classic script, not a module. index.html's own script is classic and
   inline, and a module here would be deferred past it, so every symbol below
   would be missing at the moment the board first needs it. Loaded before that
   script, these land in the shared global lexical environment and it simply
   sees them. core/test_todo.mjs picks them up the same way, out of a `vm`
   context, which is why nothing here reaches for `window`. */

/* ---- Recurring tasks ----
   Work that comes round on a cycle: the standing 1:1s, the monthly status update.
   Until now every one of them was retyped by hand, which is how the same task
   ends up on the list three times in slightly different words.

   One tag, `repeat:`, and one card. Not a template that spawns copies: a card
   per occurrence would put a ticked "prepare for the 1:1" in Done every week
   for as long as the meeting exists, and the only question ever asked of last
   week's is what was on it — which is one note, not a whole card.

     `repeat:wed`       every Wednesday
     `repeat:wed-9:15`  every Wednesday at 9:15
     `repeat:15`        the 15th of every month
     `repeat:wd5`       the fifth working day of every month
     `repeat:tue2`      the 2nd Tuesday of every month
     `repeat:tue2-15:00`  the 2nd Tuesday of every month, at 15:00
     `repeat:~thu-14:00`  roughly weekly on Thursday, but the day moves
     `repeat:wed/2`     every other Wednesday
     `repeat:15/3`      the 15th, quarterly
     `repeat:tue2/3`    the 2nd Tuesday, quarterly

   The `/n` suffix multiplies whatever comes before it: `/2` on a weekly form is
   fortnightly, `/3` on any monthly one is quarterly, and it reads the same way
   on all four bases. It is a suffix rather than four new forms because a
   quarterly meeting is not a different kind of cycle from a monthly one, it is
   the same cycle counted differently — and `[due:: ]` was already carrying the
   phase that makes "every other" mean anything.

   The nth-weekday form is for a meeting that is monthly but pinned to a
   weekday rather than a day of the month — the guild sync is
   the case: the second Tuesday, not the 13th. `wd5` already covers "the
   nth working day"; this covers "the nth Tuesday" the same way, sharing the
   nth-Monday-to-Friday-or-clamp logic with it.

   The `~` says the cadence is the usual shape rather than a rule. The design
   system drop-in is the case: it is weekly, but which day it lands on gets
   rebooked around everything else, so it ran Fri, Thu, Fri, Thu across four
   sessions. Without `~` the checker would flag every one of those as a date
   disagreeing with its tag, which is right for a fixed slot and pure noise for
   this one. The board still rolls to the tagged day, since that is the best
   default available — the date is the owner's to correct when the session moves.

   The working-day form exists because a real obligation needed it: the monthly
   status update is due by the fifth working day, which is a different date every
   month and is not expressible as a day of the month at all. Working means
   Monday to Friday here, and nothing about bank holidays — the checker already
   flags any date landing on one, and teaching two files the same holiday list
   would be two lists to keep in step.

   `[due:: ]` is the occurrence the card is currently pointing at, and the board
   moves it on once that date has passed. So the tag says how often, the date
   says which one, and neither is derivable from the other. */

   per cadence, because it multiplies every base the grammar already has — a
   quarterly report on the 15th is `15/3`, a quarterly one on the second Tuesday
   is `tue2/3`, and neither needed a new idea.

   The phase lives in `[due:: ]`, not in the tag. "Every other Wednesday" is not
   a fact about Wednesdays, it is a fact about which Wednesday you are on, and
   the card already carries that — so the interval counts from the current
   occurrence and `occurrenceAfter` is the only place it applies. A task tagged
   `/n` with no date yet gets the next plain occurrence of its base cycle, and

   Merging two saves

   Two people on one list, or one person in two tabs, each working from the
   version they last read. Until this, the second save to arrive was refused
   and its owner was asked which whole document should win, which on a shared
   list is a question asked every few minutes about edits that never touched
   each other. So a save built on an old version is merged instead: the
   version it started from (base), the save itself (mine) and the file as it
   is now (theirs), compared task by task and field by field.

   A field one side changed and the other did not takes the change. Both sides
   changing it to different values is the only conflict, and the only thing
   that ever reaches the owner as a question, named by task and field. A task
   deleted on one side and edited on the other is a conflict too, because
   either answer throws away somebody's work. Sub-tasks merge the same way,
   inside their task.

   Order is the current file's, with whatever the save added slotted in after
   the task it followed when it was added. A reorder made only on the save's
   side is the one thing a merge gives up, and it is a drag, not a task.

   Tasks are matched by `id:` first and by title only where one side has no id
   yet, which is the case of a task written by hand or by pa and given an id by
   whichever tab loaded it first. Two tabs minting two different ids for the
