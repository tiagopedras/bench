"""Reading todo.md, in Python.

The board's own reader is the JavaScript in kanban/index.html, and it stays the
authority on writing the file: only the board and the pa-* skills ever change a
task. This module is the read-only half of the same knowledge, for the things
that are not a browser tab — the desktop companion in companion/, the nightly
agent in agents/plan-agent/, the PA's consistency checker, and anything else later
that needs to know what is due without opening the board.

It lives in core/ rather than beside the board because of that list. It sat in
kanban/ while the board was its only caller, which stopped being true the moment
the companion imported it, and by the time four things did, a module every one of
them depended on was filed inside one of them.

It is a port of the parsing in index.html rather than a second design: the same
two tag syntaxes, the same `repeat:` grammar, the same occurrence maths. Where
the two disagree the board is right and this file is the bug. Ported functions
carry the name they have over there — parse_doc, read_repeat, occurrence_from —
so the pair can be read side by side.

It parses, and serialises for one caller only. Writing todo.md back out is a
whole second problem — the board keeps every blank line, rule and stray note
verbatim so a save that changed nothing gives back the same bytes — and the one
thing outside the board that needs it is the server merging two saves
(merge_saves(), at the bottom). That serialiser is private to the merge and
held to the board's answers by core/fixtures/merge.json; every other reader
here still only reads.

It also owns the UK working calendar — which days are weekends and which are
bank holidays. That is not file format, so it sits here on sufferance rather than
by right; it is here because three things need the same answer (the board, the
companion and the PA's consistency checker) and a second list of holidays
is a second list to keep in step. Everything that needs it can reach this file,
either by importing it or by having the skill build step copy it in.

The one thing it deliberately does that the board does not: rolling a recurring
task forward happens in memory only. The board rewrites the date into the file
on load; this works out the same date and keeps it to itself, so a reader can
run every minute of a day the board is never opened without ever racing it.

# extended a year at a time by somebody who remembers to, and the year it runs
# out is the year it silently starts calling every day a working day. These

# restoring four holidays in 2016 — so a generated year is right for as long as
# that holds, and wrong loudly rather than quietly if it stops.

# by government (a coronation, a jubilee, a funeral) and municipal holidays,
# neither of which follows a rule. Both are empty today.
