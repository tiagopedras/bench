"""Desktop banners for tasks that fall due, and for lines agents queue.

The board server runs this on a minute tick (kanban/server.py) and posts what it
returns through terminal-notifier. It replaces the Electron companion's
notifier, which only spoke for one list at a time and only once a morning
(companion/ stays on disk, retired).

The rules for a due banner, one per task or sub-task with a due date of its
own that is not done:

  - It fires on the due date at the item's time (`effective_time`), or at 09:00
    when it has none. A repeat task is read through `effective_due`.
  - On a weekend or public holiday it stays quiet and fires once on the next
    working day at 09:00 instead. That one reads "Overdue since ...", since the
    date has already gone by, and nothing follows it.
  - Due on a working day, one more banner, "Overdue since ...", goes out at
    09:00 on the next working day. After that it is silent.
  - A banner only goes out on its own day. A server that starts late sends what
    was owed earlier that day on its first tick, and nothing from before.

What has been sent lives per board in data/<board>/notify-state.json, so a
restart does not repeat a banner. Entries older than 14 days are dropped.

The queue half drains data/<board>/notify-queue.json, which companion/notify.py
appends to, by the rules the companion used: nothing before 08:30 or after
20:00 (the `content` board is exempt), at most three per tick, the rest left for
the next one, and a line with no body is dropped.

Everything that needs a clock or a calendar takes it as an argument, so the
tests run on a fake one. Only `post` and `start` touch the machine.
