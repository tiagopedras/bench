"""Turns a parsed todo.md into the fields agents/pa_agent/skills/pa/references/templates.md
documents, so a report is rendered from real arithmetic rather than typed out
by hand against the same rules every time.

See IMPROVEMENTS.md, "Every report the PA sends is rendered by hand, so the
templates are instructions rather than code." The arithmetic mostly already
existed, in two half-written, hand-agreeing copies: check_overdue() in
check_todo.py and the headline-first ranking in agents/plan-agent/pick.py. This is
the one copy, built on core/todo.py the way both of those already read the
file, and it produces the whole of a template's context — not asked to know
about Mustache, chevron or any particular skill.

Two things are deliberately not here. `checker_flags`, `slipped` and
`context_dates` — the "what the read turned up" fields templates.md marks as
desk-only — have no aggregation built yet: nothing in this file fakes them,
so a template asking for one gets an empty list rather than a wrong answer.
And the change-report fields (`changes`, `needs_you`, `pending_count`) are
never read from todo.md at all — they come from the session that made the
change, and the caller supplies them directly to core/render.py alongside
whatever this module returns.
