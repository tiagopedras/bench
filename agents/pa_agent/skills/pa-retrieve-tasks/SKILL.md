name: pa-retrieve-tasks
description: Pull the action items captured from the owner's meetings by whatever recorder was in the room, review them with the owner one by one, and add the ones they keep to their master to-do list at data/todo.md in the Bench checkout. Use whenever the owner asks what came out of their calls, what they were actioned with, what the recorder picked up, or asks to check today's, yesterday's or this week's meetings for tasks. Phrasings include "check my calls", "any tasks from today's meetings", "what did I get actioned with", "pull my action items", "what came out of that working group", "did I pick anything up in that call", and "add my meeting tasks to my list". Also use when the owner names one meeting and wants its actions. Do not use it to summarise a meeting the owner just wants to read, to create new action items in the recorder, or to review the to-do list itself, which is pa-checkin. pa-checkin does not call it by default; it runs only when the owner asks.

# Meeting actions into the to-do list

`$BENCH_ROOT` is the Bench checkout: the `BENCH_ROOT` environment variable, or `~/Code/bench` when unset. Before running any command or reading any file below, `cd "${BENCH_ROOT:-$HOME/Code/bench}"`. Paths in this skill are relative to the checkout.

**Read `agents/pa_agent/PA.md` first, then `CONVENTIONS.md`.** The first holds who the owner is, where the list lives, how the owner prioritises, the standing rules and the tone. The second holds the file format. Neither is repeated below.

Something sits in the owner's meetings and writes down who agreed to do what. This skill
moves the ones that are the owner's onto the list and closes them where they came from, so
that the record of a decision and the record of the work are the same record, in
one place.

It exists because the two systems drift within a day. The recorder holds an action
item that nobody reads again, the list holds the work the owner actually plans against,
and the gap between them is where a commitment made out loud goes missing. The fix
is not to read the recorder more often. It is to empty it into the list, on
purpose, and know that the list is complete.

The process below is the same whatever recorded the meeting. What changes per
source is mechanical, and it lives in a notes file per recorder: `references/sources/<recorder>.md` if the repo ships one, else `data/docs/<recorder>.md`.

## Which source

Read the **Meeting recorder** section of the profile (`<memory_root>/me/profile.md` (when `memory_root` is set and the file exists) or `data/profile.md`). It names the recorder
and holds the owner's account details for it (which account it joins under, how the owner
appears in it).

- **No recorder is set**: say so in one line and stop. Do not ask which one to use and do not guess.
- **A recorder is set**: read `references/sources/<recorder>.md`, or `data/docs/<recorder>.md` if that is where the notes are, and use it. If neither file exists, carry on with the recorder's own tools and say that no notes were found, rather than guessing at them.
- **The owner names a different one in the request**: use that one, if its file exists.

Read the source file before the first call. It carries the tool names, and on an
MCP source those schemas are usually deferred, so they need fetching before they
can be called at all.

## What a source file has to answer

Seven things, and the process below assumes all seven. A source that cannot answer
them is not ready to be added.

1. **How to connect**, and how to tell whether it is connected.
2. **How to list what it captured for a date window**, including how it paginates.
3. **How each item names the person it was assigned to.**
4. **How to recognise the owner** in that field, which is rarely the owner's work email.
5. **How to get more context** when an item's wording is too thin to act on — the meeting, the transcript, the search.
6. **What to write in the provenance note**, so a task carries the meeting it came from.
7. **What timestamp on each item says when the recorder created it**, since that is what the watermark is compared against.

It should also say what the source gets wrong, because every one of them has a
house style and knowing it in advance is what stops a bad task reaching the owner.

## What this skill does not do

**It does not write to the source at all.** Recorders offer tools to create action
items and, on some, to tick them off. This skill calls none of them. Two lists that
both claim to be the plan is the failure this whole repo is built to avoid, and the
list is the one that wins.

Closing items in the recorder was tried and dropped. Some recorders have no tool
to tick an item off, so there was nothing to call, and the wider point held
anyway: the owner does not work out of the recorder's interface, so its state is not worth
maintaining. What the owner needs is not a tidy recorder, it is never being shown the same
action item twice.

That is what the watermark does, and it is strictly better than closing things
would have been. Closing only covers what the owner kept. The watermark covers everything
the owner was shown, including what the owner declined, which is the larger pile.

The watermark says a decline happened, not what it was. Getting back to one meant
naming a wider window by hand and re-reading everything in it, declines and all, to
find the one line the owner actually wanted. `data/<dataset>/meeting-declines.md` fixes
that: every declined item is logged there as it happens, so a specific decline can
be found and revisited on its own without re-pulling anything. See **Log the
declines** under Move 4, and **Revisiting a decline** under Judgement calls.

**It does not add anything without asking.** A recorder captures action items for
everyone in the room, and its wording is a machine's summary of what was said. Most
of what comes back is not the owner's, and some of what is the owner's is already on the list under
a better title. The review is the point of the skill; the pull is the easy half.

**It does not apply the file conventions itself.** Once the owner has picked what to keep,
hand the writing to `pa`. That skill owns the buckets, the scores, the tag
syntax and the checker, and it is the only thing that edits todo.md.

## The five moves

### 1. Pull

**Read the watermark first.** It is the `Meeting actions last pulled` line in the
header of todo.md, a UTC timestamp, and the window runs from there to now. Move 5
sets it. Everything before it the owner has already been shown and already decided about,
kept or declined, and showing it again is the one thing this skill must not do.

Filter on when the recorder created each item, not on when the meeting happened. A
call on Friday afternoon whose actions were written up on Monday morning belongs to
Monday's pull, and matching on the meeting time would drop it.

**When the watermark says `never`,** or the line is missing, fall back to the start
of the previous business day. On a Tuesday that is Monday and Tuesday. On a Monday
it is Friday onwards, so the weekend is inside the window rather than a hole in it,
and the same holds for the Tuesday after a bank holiday Monday.

Business day here means what it means everywhere else in this system: weekends
are out and UK bank holidays are out, since the team is UK-based. The England and
Wales dates for 2026 and 2027 are in
`agents/pa_agent/skills/pa/scripts/check_todo.py`, which is the
authority when a date is borderline.

**When the owner names a window, the owner's wins.** "This week" means Monday to today. "Go back
to last Wednesday" means exactly that, watermark ignored, which is also how a
decline gets revisited. Say that the watermark was overridden when it was, since
the owner will otherwise see items the owner has already turned down and think the skill is
broken.

Say which days were covered when reporting back. "Nothing from your calls" means
something different over one day than over a weekend, and the owner cannot tell which
one the owner is being told without the dates.

Ask the source for two things over that window, in the same message since neither
depends on the other:

- **The meetings themselves**, so the report can name the calls that were checked and produced nothing. That line matters more than it looks: it is the difference between "no tasks for you" and "no tasks for you, and here is the proof I looked."
- **The action items**, with the assignee, the completion state, the creation timestamp and which meeting each came from.

Follow the pagination all the way. A truncated pull that reads as complete is worse
than no pull.

Only go back for the full meeting when an item's wording is ambiguous enough that
you cannot write it into the list without guessing. That is common: recorders write
summaries, not instructions, and something like "address the design system board
task regarding read-only states" needs the room's context before it is a task
anybody can start. Read the transcript when the summary is not enough. Do not read
every meeting by reflex.

### 2. Filter

Three piles, and only the first one is the owner's:

- **The owner's, open.** These are the candidates.
- **The owner's, already marked done in the source.** The owner did them in the meeting or straight after. Never add these to the list, and never add them pre-ticked either — a done task arriving on the list is noise with no future. Name them in one line so the owner knows they were seen, and if they say one is not actually finished, it moves to the first pile.
- **Everybody else's.** These stay out, including the ones that mention the owner. "Send the owner the file" is somebody else's task and putting it on the owner's list makes the owner responsible for chasing their own file. At most it is one closing line, and only when the owner is waiting on the output.

The one exception in the third pile: a task assigned to someone who reports to the owner,
where the real work is the owner's to unblock or follow up. That is a judgement call, so
raise it as a question rather than adding it.

### 3. Review

One message. Number the owner's open tasks, and for each one give:

- the task, rewritten as an instruction rather than a summary
- the meeting it came from and the time
- **new** or **already on the list**, with the existing task's title where it is a duplicate
- the bucket, state and both scores you would give it

Then one question: which of these to add. The owner answers with numbers.

**Check for duplicates before this message, not after.** Grep todo.md for the
distinctive nouns in each task, not for the whole sentence, since the recorder's
phrasing will never match the owner's. Search the whole file including ticked tasks, and
check `data/backups/done-archive.md` too, because something finished last month and
archived out is a different answer from something that was never on the list. A
task that already exists as a sub-step of something bigger counts as a duplicate,
and saying which parent it sits under is the useful part of that line.

**Rewrite the wording before showing it to the owner.** A recorder writes "Explore other
design systems' form and input field states to replicate best practices for
accessibility." The list wants the thing to do and the object it acts on. Drop
"address", "regarding", "ensure proper", and anything that describes the discussion
rather than the work. Keep the specifics — a name, a file, a board, a date — those
are what make it startable later.

### 4. Add

Invoke `pa` with what the owner kept, and let it do the writing: bucket,
state, `[impact:: ]`, `[effort:: ]`, `[ai:: ]`, a suggested message on any step
whose work is contacting somebody, and the checker before delivering.

Two things to pass through to it, since they come from here and it cannot know them:

- **The provenance line.** Every task from a meeting carries a note saying which meeting and which date: "From the Platform WG on 27 Aug." It explains why the task exists to whoever reads it in three weeks, and it is what makes the next duplicate check work.
- **Anything the transcript said that the task text lost.** A deadline somebody named out loud, a person who has to be involved, the reason it was raised. That context is in the meeting and nowhere else, and it is the whole reason a task written from a transcript beats a task written from a title.

New tasks go to **To do** or **Backlog**. Never to Doing, even when the owner agreed in the
meeting to start it today, because Doing is the owner's own statement about what is live.

**Log the declines.** For every candidate from Move 3 the owner did not pick, append one
line to `data/<dataset>/meeting-declines.md` (create it, with the heading below, if
it does not exist yet):

```
# Declined meeting actions

Every item this skill has shown the owner and the owner chose not to add — recorded so one can
be found and revisited by name later, without re-pulling and re-showing everything
else from the same window. Nothing here is ever deleted: a decline that is later
added gets a second line saying so: the first line stays as the record that it was
once turned down.

## 2026-09-03 pull

- **Send the Q3 board deck to Morgan for review.** From the Platform WG on 27 Aug 2026.
```

One `## <date> pull` section per pull, the rewritten task text bolded exactly as it
was shown to the owner, then the provenance line, same wording as what would have gone on
the task had the owner kept it. That is what a later search matches against. Skip the
already-marked-done pile from Move 2 — those were never a decline, they were already
finished — but do log the third pile's borderline case (someone who reports to the owner)
when the owner says no to raising it, since that is a real decline too.

### 5. Stamp

Move the watermark forward, so nothing in this pull is ever shown to the owner again.

It lives on the `Meeting actions last pulled` line in the header of todo.md, as a
full UTC timestamp. `never` is a valid value and means no pull has happened yet.
`pa` owns that line's format; this skill owns its value.

**Set it to the end of the window that was pulled, not to the moment the writing
finished.** Those differ by however long the review took, and a task the recorder
created while the owner was reading the review would be skipped forever if the stamp
overshot it.

**After the writing, never before.** If `pa` fails halfway, or the owner walks
away mid-review, a watermark already moved has silently swallowed everything in
that window. Write the tasks, log the declines, confirm both landed, then stamp.

**Stamp whatever the owner was shown, not what they kept.** The declines are the point. The owner
has already decided about them, and asking again tomorrow is the exact noise this
step exists to stop. The decline log is what makes that safe to do without also
losing the ability to go back to one on request — see **Revisiting a decline**
below.

**Say the new value in the closing line.** It is the one piece of state this skill
writes, and a stamp that moved when the owner thought it had not is how a day of meetings
goes missing without anybody noticing.

## Judgement calls that come up

**The owner asks to revisit a decline.** "Actually let's add that thing about X I skipped",
naming a meeting, a subject or roughly what it said. Grep
`data/<dataset>/meeting-declines.md` for it rather than re-pulling from the source —
the text is already sitting there with its provenance, and re-pulling would mean
widening the watermark and re-showing everything else from that window as well,
declines the owner meant to leave declined included.

Found, run it through Filter and the duplicate check again before offering it —
time has passed, and it may have been added a different way since, or somebody else
may have picked it up. If the owner confirms, hand it to `pa` exactly as Move 4
does, carrying the same provenance line, then append a second line under the
original entry in the decline log: `  → added 2026-09-10`, dated the day this
happened, so the log still shows it was once turned down and shows what changed. If
the owner still doesn't want it, leave the entry as it is — one look was the whole point of
asking.

Not found by name, ask which meeting or roughly when, since the log is grepped by
what the item says and a vague description will not match on the first try. Still
nothing, it may be old enough that only a wider pull of the source itself will find
it — that is the fallback this replaces, not a case it removes.

**The recorder split one thing into three tasks.** Meetings circle a subject, so the
same commitment gets captured three times in different words. Propose it as one
task with the three as sub-steps, and say that is what you did.

**A task is the owner's but belongs to a project rather than the list.** If it needs a
plan, a ticket history or source documents behind it, that is
`data/projects/<name>/`, and the list carries one line pointing at it. Ask rather
than deciding.

**The action item is really a fact about a person.** Somebody going on leave, a
contract ending, who now owns a board. That goes in `## Context` in todo.md, not
into a bucket. The test is the same one the other skill uses: would the owner ever tick it.

**A task has a date somebody said in the room.** Trust it, and say in the review
line that the date came from the meeting rather than from you. A date agreed out
loud is stronger evidence than anything else this process produces.

**Nothing came back for the owner.** Say so in two lines: the meetings checked, and that
none carried a task for the owner. Do not go hunting through transcripts for work the owner
might have implicitly picked up. The recorder not finding a task is a real answer.

**The owner asks about one meeting rather than a day.** Find it however the source file
says to, then pull its tasks. The other three moves are unchanged.

**Two sources recorded the same meeting.** Pull from one. The duplicate check runs
against todo.md, not against the other recorder, so taking both puts the same task
in front of the owner twice with different wording.

## Tone

See `agents/pa_agent/PA.md`.

The review message is the one place a numbered list is right, since the owner is answering it with numbers.

## Adding another source

1. Create `data/docs/<name>.md` (private) or `references/sources/<name>.md` (shared).
2. Make it answer the seven questions above for the new recorder: how to connect, how to list meetings, how to read an item, and what each item's timestamp means.
3. Put the recorder's name in the **Meeting recorder** section of the profile (`<memory_root>/me/profile.md` (when `memory_root` is set and the file exists) or `data/profile.md`), with the owner's account details for it.
