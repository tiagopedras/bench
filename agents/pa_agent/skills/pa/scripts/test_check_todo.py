"""Proof that check_todo.py's slug check sees done-archive.md.

Archiving (kanban/js/25-archiving.js) runs on its own now, hourly, so a task
that has been ticked off for more than ARCHIVE_DAYS quietly leaves todo.md.
Before archived_slugs() existed in check_todo.py, its slug left with it, and
check_slugs() had no way to tell an archived task's #slug from a typo — every
blocked-by: pointing at work that had simply finished and aged out read as a
dangling reference. See IMPROVEMENTS.md, "check_todo.py has no archive
reader."

    python3 test_check_todo.py

No JavaScript counterpart: there is no board-side equivalent of this script
to keep in step with, the same reason core/test_reports.py stands alone.
