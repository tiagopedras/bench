"""pa_save.py against a real board server, never the live one.

    python3 agents/pa_agent/skills/pa/scripts/test_pa_save.py

No browser. It starts kanban/server.py on free ports (never 8765 or 8766) over
a throwaway data root, through test_board_access.Server, once as the Mac board
and once signed in, and runs pa_save.py as the PA would. The real data/ is
never read or written, and the copies go to a temp folder ($PA_SAVE_DIR).

What it holds to:

  * on the Mac, with no token, the PA pulls, edits and pushes a board that is
    not the one on screen, which stays on screen, and the log says pa did it;
  * a save landing between the pull and the push is merged, not lost;
  * the same thing changed by both is a 409: the conflicts are printed,
    nothing is written, the exit is 1, and the copy and theirs.md stay;
  * a pull will not go over an edit that was never pushed, unless told to;
  * a board that does not exist, or a request held to one board asking for
    anything but its list, is refused;
  * a host that is not this Mac is refused without a token, a token is never
    sent over http to one, and when there is one it goes as a bearer token;
  * signed in, X-Offdesk-Board holds the PA identity to its board, which it
    must be named in, and the save is logged under the PA's own address.
