# --apply records the current commits, fetches, checks out the refs, installs
# and builds the board's front end, restarts bench.service and waits up to 20 s
# for the board to answer (200, or 302 and 401 under sign-in). If it does not, the recorded commits go back and
# the service restarts again. data/ is never touched.
