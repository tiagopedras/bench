With BENCH_AUTH=header a board without data/<board>/access.json is visible to
nobody, so each board already on a server needs this once. After that its
owner changes the sharing from the board's Settings. `--owner` is needed the
first time; later runs keep the owner and add the teams and people given, or
replace them with `--replace`.

Reads $TODOS_DATA_ROOT like the server, else the checkout's data/. Writes the
file only; nothing needs restarting, since the server reads it on every request.
