"""Who wrote each task, who last changed it, and the list's activity log.

    python3 kanban/test_authorship.py

No browser. It starts kanban/server.py itself on free ports (never 8765 or
8766) over a throwaway data root, signed in with BENCH_AUTH=header on a board
two people share, and once as the Mac board. The real data/ is never read or
written.

What it holds to:

  * signed in, a task someone adds is created by the email nginx sent, and a
    task or sub-task someone changes is last edited by it;
  * a tab cannot say either: what it sends for created-by or edited-by is put
    back to what the file says, on a task it changed or one it did not;
  * every save's changes land in data/<board>/activity.jsonl, one line per
    task, with who, their name and what changed, and /activity.json reads them
    back newest first with a name for each email;
  * on the Mac nobody signs in: no tag is written, a file without them comes
    back byte for byte, and the log names the owner from the profile;
  * a sub-task an agent asked to tick (core/tick_queue.py), applied by the
    board and saved by whoever's tab drained it, goes under the agent: the
    card is edited by `implement-agent` and the log says Implement agent,
    while anything else in the same save stays the saver's; a request the
    board refuses credits nobody;
  * an edit written straight to todo.md, the way the pa skill writes, is
    logged under `pa` the next time the server reads the list and, signed in,
    stamped on the cards it changed; held while pa-working.json says pa is
    mid-edit; and on the Mac logged with no tag written.
