"""The save path's edges that need the server in this process to reach.

    python3 kanban/test_save_inprocess.py

kanban/server.py runs in a thread here, over a temp folder, with the list it
saves to and the person asking set by hand. That is how the cases below are
reached at all: a board with no todo.md is never offered by the routes, and
a lock is only visible from inside. The real data/ is never read or written.

What it holds to:

  * the first save to a list with no todo.md yet cannot carry forged authors:
    every task is created by whoever signed in;
  * the board's drain of agent requests holds the save lock while it reads
    the queue, credits the agents and takes the requests out, so no save can
    land between the version it credits from and the removal;
  * an outside writer is never written over: a file still being written (a
    slow, non-atomic write with a pause in it) is left alone until it has
    settled, and a write landing between the server's read and its stamp is
    not replaced by the stamp.
