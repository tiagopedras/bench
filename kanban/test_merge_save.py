"""Two saves on one list, merged by the server rather than refused.

    python3 kanban/test_merge_save.py

No browser. It starts kanban/server.py itself on free ports (never 8765 or
8766) over a throwaway data root, once as the Mac board and once signed in
with BENCH_AUTH=header and a board two people share, and saves the way the
board does: {text, base} as JSON. The real data/ is never read or written.

What it holds to:

  * a save built on the version on disk is written as sent;
  * two saves built on one version, on different tasks, both land, whichever
    arrives second, and so do the same task's different fields;
  * the same field changed apart is a 409 naming the task and field, carrying
    the file as it stands, and nothing is written; nor for a task deleted on
    one side and edited on the other;
  * the answer to a conflict saves, built on the file the 409 carried;
  * two saves sent at the same moment are taken one at a time, so neither
    is written over unseen;
  * the reply says which version it wrote, matching a read straight after;
  * a bare document (a script, a tab from before this) is still refused when
    the file moved under it, and still needs If-Unmodified-Since.
