   only from inside a text field, so a plain confirmation like offerReload()'s
   cannot be answered by a stray shortcut aimed at something else. Tenon's
   Modal does both; this function only says what the buttons run.

   makes Escape and the scrim do nothing (first-run setup); required and keepOpen
   both stop a button closing the modal for its run(), which closes it itself
   once it has what it needs; wide is the document-width variant a written
   report opens in, rather than the confirmation-sized default; cls is one more
   class on the box, for a modal with a body shape of its own (the plan
   reader); onClose runs once when the modal goes, whichever way it goes.
