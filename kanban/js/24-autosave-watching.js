   pa at work

   The pa skill names the tasks it is about to change in pa-working.json,
   beside todo.md, before its first edit, and deletes the file after its last
   (agents/pa_agent/skills/pa/scripts/pa_working.py). While the file is there
   the cards it named glow and watchTick() holds its reload. Once it goes, the
   reload happens straight away rather than up to fifteen seconds later, every
   card slides from where it was to where it is now, and the ones that changed
   glow once more and fade.

   Polled on a clock of its own, since the file usually lives for seconds and
   the fifteen-second one would mostly miss it. A file older than ten minutes
   is a session that stopped halfway, and is ignored. Only pa writes it: an
   agent's tick reaches the board through tick-queue.json and is applied by
   the board itself, so nothing here lights for one.

   The glow is a style sheet of its own naming cards by data-id, rather than a
   class on each card, so a React redraw of the board while pa works cannot
   take it off. How it looks is board.css, under the same heading. */
