   The hosted copy (Vercel) serves static files and nothing else, so on its own

   pointed at a list folder on the person's own disk through the File System
   Access API, and read and write todo.md there itself with no helper running.
   Where the browser has no showDirectoryPicker the demo stays exactly as it
   was: read-only, with nothing new on the lock bar.

   Only reached from the demo. The local board served by kanban/server.py
   never gets here, because loadFile() reads /data/todo.md first and a real
   list always wins, so nothing below changes how the local board behaves.

   The folder is one list, the same shape as data/<dataset>/: todo.md at its
   root, and backups/ beside it. What the page does with it:
     - reads and writes todo.md, with the same change-on-disk check the server
       makes (a hash of what this tab last read, compared before every write);
     - writes one backup of the file as it found it into backups/ before the
       first save of each visit, named the way the server names its own;
     - keeps a crash copy of unsaved work in localStorage, dropped after every
       good save and offered back the next time the folder is opened.
   Everything else the board asks the server for stays unanswered, exactly as
   on the demo: /plans.json, /reports.json, /backups.json, /projects.json,
   /schedule.json and /queue.json are plain file reads and could be answered
   from the folder in a later pass; the terminal, the planning agent, the
   companion and the Claude chat need a process and never can be.

   opened here is only as safe as that copy of the code. The dialog before the
