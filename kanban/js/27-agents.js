/* =========================================================================
   4d. Agents — what each agent does, and the Plan and Implement agents'
   switches, hours and runs.

   The switches and hours are the agents dashboard's own page,
   PACKAGES/agents-engine/react, reached as BoardUI.AgentsApp, so this view and
   ~/Code/agents-dashboard draw one hour track rather than two. It asks
   /agents-api/* (kanban/server.py), which runs agents-engine's routes over this
   repo's agents/ folder only, so the agents on it are the two the board hands
   work to. Every change goes through the agent's own `apply` command; nothing
   here or in the server opens a schedule file.

   Under it, one card per agent from AGENT_CARDS (02-state.js): what it does,
   what it cannot do and what it needs from the person. Plain HTML beside the
   React root rather than inside it, since the component is shared with the
   dashboard and the cards are this board's own words.

   The component owns everything on screen, including its twenty-second poll of
   every agent's state. That poll is why leaving the view unmounts it: a root
   left behind on a node the next view has replaced keeps polling, and each
   poll runs both agents' state commands.
   ========================================================================= */

/* ---- Is there an agent on this list yet? ----

   Someone who only uses the PA to keep their list has no use for the agent
   half of the board, so until the list has an agent set up the board leaves
   it out: no agents under Delegate to, no Delegate to Claude on Overview, and
   this tab shows the cards and the way to set one up instead of the hour
   tracks. The agent filter chip already hides itself while nothing is
   delegated.

   A list counts as set up when any of these holds:
     - a bucket has a planner of its own on disk (`fallback` false in
       /bucket-brief.json), which is how the lists this board was built on
       came to have agents before any of this existed;
     - a bucket's brief has a section the person wrote, rather than the
       template's own prose — a new list's wizard scaffolds every brief with a
       one-line summary and no marker, so `filled` alone would count every
       new list as set up;
     - a task, or one of its sub-tasks, is already delegated to an agent.
   Until the briefs have answered, or where there is no server to ask (the
   demo build), it counts as set up, so nothing is hidden on a guess. */

   Someone new to agents is asked four things about one of their buckets: what
   the agent should be like, what tasks it does there, whether there is
   documentation on how those tasks are run, and what the output looks like
   and in what form. The answers are written into that bucket's brief,
   `data/<dataset>/buckets/<stream>/<stream>.md`, the file the Plan agent and
   the Implement agent already read before working a task from that bucket. So
   what the person tells it stays in their own data folder, out of git, and
   the tracked planners in agents/plan-agent/ stay as shipped.

   Where the answers land in the brief's four sections (BRIEF_SECTIONS,
   08-buckets.js), so the bucket's own brief editor opens on them unchanged:
     tasks          -> The processes I run in this bucket
     documentation  -> What already does it
     like, output   -> What good looks like here
   A section still holding the template's guidance is replaced; one someone
   already wrote keeps its text, and the answer goes under it.

   One sheet per step, since showModal() closes the sheet before running a
   button: the answers live in agentWizard and each field writes to it as it
